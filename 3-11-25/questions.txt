1. Average of Elements
Concept: First compute the sum, then divide by the number of elements.
 arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
Average of array elements: 30.0

2.Search for an Element (Linear Search)
Concept: Traverse array linearly and compare each value with the target.
  
arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
Enter search key  : 30
Output: value found
Enter search key: 300
Output: value not found 

3.Count Frequency of Each Element
Concept: Use nested loops or a hash map to count how often each number appears.
 Example:  arr = [4, 5, 6, 4, 5, 7, 4]
Output:
Element 4 occurs 3 times 
Element 5 occurs 2 times 
Element 6 occurs 1 time 
Element 7 occurs 1 time  

4.Reverse an Array
Concept: Swap elements from both ends moving toward the center.
 Use Case: Invert order of operations or list of commands.
Example: arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
Reversed array: [50, 40, 30, 20, 10]

5.Right Rotate an Array by 1 or K Positions
Concept: Shift elements to the right and bring the last to front.
 Use Case: Buffer manipulation.
Input: arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
Right rotated array by 2 positions: [40, 50, 10, 20, 30]
