Q1. Write program to create class name as Factorial with two functions
       void setValue(int x): this function accept number as parameter
      int getFactorial(): this function can calculate factorial of number and return it.
Q2. Write program to create class name as CheckChar with two functions
        void setChar(char ch): this function accept single character as input
      boolean checkChar(): this function can check character is alphabet or digit of special     symbol if
     character is alphabet or digit return true if character is digit then return false.
Q3. Write program to create class name as FindMax with two functions
       void setArray(int a[]): this function is used for accept array as parameter
       int getMax(): this function can find the max value from array and return it.
Q4. Write program to create class name as Area with constructor overloading
       Area(float radius): this function can accept radius as input and calculate circle Area
      Area(int len,int width): this function can accept len and width as input and calculate area of rectangle
Q5. Write program to create class name as MergeTwoArray with parameterized constructor
      MergeTwoArray(int [],int []): this constructor accept two array as parameter
      int [] getMergeArray(): this function merge two array in third array and return new merged    array
6.Find All Pairs with Given Sum
Concept: Use nested loops or two-pointer technique to check sums.
 Use Case: Match contributors, tasks, etc., that add up to a budget.
arr = [1, 5, 7, -1, 5]
Target sum (S) = 6
Example: Pairs with sum 6:
(5, 1)
(-1, 7)
(5, 1)
7.Find Majority Element (Occurs > n/2 Times)
Concept: Use count method or Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm.
 Use Case: Identify the dominating product, preference, etc.
Inut : arr = [2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]
Size (n) = 7
Majority element is: 2

8. Rearrange Array in Alternate Positive and Negative Items
Concept: Use auxiliary arrays or index manipulation to interleave.
 Use Case: Alternate scheduling, balancing data flow.
Input: arr = [2, 3, -4, -1, 6, -9]
 
Separate positives: [2, 3, 6]
Separate negatives: [-4, -1, -9]
Rearranged array: [2, -4, 3, -1, 6, -9]
